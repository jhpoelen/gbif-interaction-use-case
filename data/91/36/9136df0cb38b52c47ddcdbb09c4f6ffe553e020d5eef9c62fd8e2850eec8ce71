Use Case: Biotic Interactions - Sottunga Island Melitaea cinxia Population Study
Status: Reviewed (2023-11-26)
Summary
This case study is based on the work described in Duplouy et al. 2021, which explores the long-term population dynamics of the butterfly Melitaea cinxia following its introduction to the Åland island Sottunga along with, unknown at the time, the parasitoid Hyposoter horticola and the hyperparasitoid Mesochorus cf. stigmaticus. In addition to this hierarchy of dependent relationships, the study also investigated the effect on the success of the hyperparasitoids based on the presence or absence of the endosymbiont bacteria Wolbachia pipientis in the parasitoid host. A total of 323 caterpillars from five distinct locations between 1992 and 2013 were collected, reared, and assessed for the presence of the parasitoids, hyperparasitoids and Wolbachia. The complex set of relationships between the host butterfly, parasitic wasp, hyperparasitic wasp and bacterial infection was shown to affect the phenotype of the host butterfly as well as population dynamics that ultimately maintain genetic diversity on the island despite multiple observed population bottlenecks.


Highlights
* Events have multiple entities of interest between which multiple relationships can be asserted (relationships are not in and of themselves the entities of interest)
* Chains of proximate dependency of relationships can be captured
* Specimens and DNA extracts are left out of the model (they are captured in other use cases) to focus on the relationships.
Concepts - see Glossary
Conceptual Model
There is a wide variety of biotic interactions that can be thought of as happening at distinct scales. Interactions tend to be described as relationships[a][b][c][d][e] between dwc:Organisms and dwc:Taxa in any combination of those two types, plus their complementary inverse relationships. For example, if O is a dwc:Organism (e.g., a biological individual) and T is a dwc:Taxon (at whatever taxonomic rank), the following combinations can be found: O1 relatedTo O2, O2 inverseRelatedTo O1; O1 related to T1, T1 inverseRelatedTo O1; T1 relatedTo T2, T2 inverseRelatedTo T1. All of these can be modeled as dwc:Organism relationships, where relationships strictly involving identifiable dwc:Organisms can be thought of as involving "this" dwc:Organism while relationships involving dwc:Taxa can be thought of as involving "some" dwc:Organism. All relationships would use dwc:Organism identifiers and the relationshipType could distinguish between scales, while Taxon-scale subjects and objects would have no non-empty dwc:Organism properties. 


A second feature of the model is to provide the capacity to posit that there is a sequential dependency among relationships using a link from one relationship to another one on which it directly depends. This is beyond the simple capacity to express the order in which relationships occurred, provided naturally from the Relationships being based on dwc:Events. It provides the ability to track dependencies that are more complex than just co-occurring or sequential.  The model supports complex multiple co-occurrent relationships to be modeled independently as pairwise relationships.


Finally, the model treats a Relationship as an assertion applied to a subject and object, each of which are an EntityOfInterest in a dwc:Event. A distinct object for the relationship is deemed preferable to treating the Relationship as an EntityOfInterest itself or as a dwc:Event directly. 


  



Figure 1: A conceptual model (2024-04-04) covering the assertions associated with an observed set of host / parasitoid / hyperparasitoid / endosymbiont relationships in Melitaea cinxia / Hyposoter horticola / Mesochorus stigmaticus / Wolbachia pipientis [f][g][h][i]without reference to specific specimens or DNA extractions.


The long-term ecological study of the metapopulation dynamics of Melitaea cinxia in the Åland Islands can be captured as a parent-most Event. Within the project the specific study resulting in the cited manuscript can be captured as another Event. The five distinct localities in the study form the set of Location records. The combination of Location and time of collection of host caterpillars form specific collecting Events within the study. Individual caterpillars collected in these Events and reared in the laboratory are target Organisms (each an EntityOfInterest). Each parasitoid and hyperparasitoid detected during rearing is also a target Organism (and also an EntityOfInterest). [j][k][l][m]


Though the butterflies, parasitoids and hyperparasitoids were collected (together), that aspect of the study is not modeled here as it is covered in other use cases and allows this model to focus on the relationships between the Organisms. DNA extracts from the wasps identifying the presence of the endosymbiont bacteria are modeled simply as additional Organisms participating in the collecting Event because the extract, sequence and identification aspects of the study are also covered in other use cases. Thus, Taxon Identifications of Organisms here are a simplification that represents two distinct processes, one based on morphology and one based on DNA.


The relationships between Organisms are modeled as Assertions involving pairwise combinations, each joined with the specific relationship type that binds them (see Table 1). In this case study, for example, non-parasitized butterflies would have no relationship records; a parasitized butterfly would have a "parasitizedBy[n][o][p][q]" relationship to a parasitoid and the parasitoid would have a complementary "parasitized" relationship to the butterfly; a hyperparasitized Hyposoter individual would have a "parasitizedBy" relationship to a hyperparasite Mesochorus cf. stigmaticus and the hyperparasite would have a "parasitized" relationship to the Hyposoter individual; Hyposoter individuals infected with the endosymbiont would have a "hadEndosymbiont" relationship to the bacteria (modeled as an Organism) and the bacteria would have a "wasEndoSymbiontOf" relationship to the Hyposoter individual.

Table 1. Examples of possible Relationships between hosts, parasitoids and a bacterium. The ID column represents an identifier for the Relationship rows. Mc1 identifies a specific individual Melitaea cinxia, Hh1 identifies a specific individual Hyposoter horticola, Ms1 identifies a specific individual Mesochorus cf. stigmaticus, and Wp denotes the presence of the bacteria Wolbachia pipientis. *Note that string literal values for relationship type have been given here, but community-curated controlled vocabulary IRIs should be supported.


In addition to the pairwise relationships given above, it would be possible to posit (using the dependentOnRelationshipID[r][s]) that a hyperparasitoid relationship existed between an individual butterfly and a Mesochorus individual and that this relationship depended on the relationship expressed in the parasitization of the butterfly by a Hyposoter individual. For example, the value of dependentOnRelationshipID for row 5 in Table 1 would be either 1 or 2.
An arbitrary number of Assertions can be made about each class. Assertions can be quantitative or qualitative and can have Assertions made about them as well. Agents can have roles with respect to any class as well, including Assertions. Instances of any class may be referenced in Citations and have alternate Identifiers. These four common aspects of all use cases can be found in Common Models.

[a]Suggest to include reference to studies that support your claim of use of biotic interactions.
[b]Agreed. Sure that interactions can be described as relationships between dwc:Organism and dwc:Taxa, but what I have seen mostly is the relationship between dwc:Occurrence's (Occ1 related to Occ2 and Occ2 inverseRelatedTo Occ2). Although dwc:Occurrence relateds to dwc:Organism and dwc:Taxa, I don't think that there is a "tendency" to describe interactions like that. The most used form to represent interactions in GBIF registry is the adoption of dwc:associatedTaxa (so dwc:Occurrence->"dwc:Taxa" relationships). I can provide examples of datasets if needed.
[c]Yes, please provide examples and make further comments in https://discourse.gbif.org/t/use-case-biotic-interactions-sottunga-island-melitaea-cinxia-population-study/3312/2.
[d]Respectfully, I have spent many (unpaid) hours in assisting you in developing these use cases. If you are serious about this, I'd suggest you actually pay people for their contributions.
[e]This, and the considerable delay between my comments (years), makes me hesitant to contribute. Please let me know if you have any ideas to make our collaboration for mutually beneficial.
[f]would expect specific instantiation of the model with provided example. Currently only the abstract model is shown.
[g]This is planned as part of further development of the Use Case.
[h]A specific instantiation of a publishing model has been produced and shared at https://github.com/gbif/model-interactions/blob/master/gbif/schema_publishing_bi.sql.
[i]In my mind, sharing a sql query is does not answer my question. Also, note that requesting the content associated to the URL caused a 404 not found.
[j]I expect that most readers think in tables. So, I'd suggest to provide worked out examples of what the data of this use case would look like in dwc-a ish table structure.
[k]Yes. Exemplar datasets will follow for the case studies
[l]These can be found in the folders within https://github.com/gbif/model-interactions/tree/master.
[m]Thanks for responding. The link you shared produced a 404 Not Found at time of writing. Suggest to share citations instead of URLs.
[n]I would expect both labels and URI. In your text, only labels are provided.
[o]The point of Use Case development is not to enter into vocabularies until that is needed. We feel it will not elucidate anything to do so at this stage.
[p]Made a note in the Table 1 caption to the effect that controlled vocabulary IRIs should be supported.
[q]Thanks for replying. Suggest add explicit examples of such "community-curated" controlled vocabulary IRIs. We are not starting from scratch here. . .
[r]I'm not sure if this is really need. Trying to think more about it. Relations Ontology defines the terms "hyperparasitized by' (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002554) and "parasites by" (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002445). So, the relationships in the table could be represented as:
Mc1 "parasitedBy" Hh1; Hh1 "parasitedBy" Ms1 and Mc1 "hyperparasitizedBy" Ms1. I'm not sure, it theses statements are equivalent, we need to think about it. If they are equivalent, we can avoid miting a new term and use dwc:ResRelat as it is (and many dataset are using it that way)
[s]Additionally, dwc:ResRelat is flexible enough so we can do things like: a dwc:ResourceRelationship R1 related to a dwc:ResourceRelationship R2 ... expressing some dependency or relationship between relationships. May be it will bring more complexity and make thing more difficult to the users, but the doing that way the dependencies can also be treated as assertions (with the person responsible for that)
[t]I can see how your can make positive statements ("I saw this", "I claim that ..." ). How does your model account for dispute? (e.g.,"I disagree with a statement that John made").
[u]This is a more general issue of annotations that is not specific to this use case and was not in scope up to now. It is a very interesting issue to explore, however. in any case, philosophically, I would argue that support dispute as dispute is counterproductive, and might better be modeled positively as alternative assertion. The important point, though, would be to make sure that the alternate Assertions about something can be clearly viewed. I believe that Assertions as modeled are capable of this. But again, it is not for this use case.
[v]In my opinion, interaction records are only as useful as their ability to be cited and annotated. So, having a way to annotate (and thus cite) a specific record version is key, and should be referenced at least.
[w]I understand that the object here is to represent the "Interactions"  as a pairwise relation between organisms/taxa, but from my experience with plant-pollinator interactions the Interactions are very context dependent. So, we with that model we will be able to answer the questions: 
- Who interacts with who?
- Where and when (dwc:Event)?
- Which is the nature (type) of the Interaction?


But, some important aspects that might helps to understand the effects and outcomes of an interaction are not represented in the model. Those effects and outcomes could be represented using dwc:MeasurementOrFact (using a CV), some to discuss.


Organisms interact each other for some reason and it has definitely  implications in the fitness of the interacting organisms , opposed to the non-interaction organisms. So, I'm wondering how we can represent it without going from the "data to knowledge" domains. 


Example: a bee visits a plant (flower) (which is well represented in the model), but someone might want to know /describe which is the sex of the flower,  what is pollen load, what are the resources collected by the bee, how it collects them ("behavior": robbery, thief, legitimate pollinator), 


We think about that beyond plant-pollinator interactions. Examples: a beetle feedsOn a plant (what is the resource collected?); a parasite of an animal (any chemical compound acts as a toxin?); An animal eats another animal (there was a hunting? Or it was opportunistic (e.g scavengers).


Sorry for long comment, I'm just trying to bring some insights for us to discuss.
[x]All of these are great examples to instantiate as alternate scenarios to test the model with. I would like to go through that exercise, but it will require a concerted collaboration.
[y]This collaboration has been done and captured in https://github.com/gbif/model-interactions.
[z]thanks for sharing the link. Unfortunately, the link generates a 404 not found error. Suggest to use published sources and cite them.
